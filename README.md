# SpotClone

A project I'm developing as a way of improving myself and getting used to React again.
Will also be doing a backend for this and I shall link it here once I get started with it.

# How to run

You're gonna need `pnpm`.

- Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/gabrielLV-BR/react-spot-clone.git`
- Install dependencies with `pnpm i`
- Run in development mode with `pnpm run dev`
- Enjoy!
